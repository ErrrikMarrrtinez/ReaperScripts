      <metadata>
        <description>This script provides quick sidechain routing from selected tracks to the track under the mouse, establishing a 3/4 sidechain by default with corresponding 3/4 LR pins for input. After selecting tracks, hovering over a track to set up a sidechain for a specific plugin opens a window displaying the plugins. Clicking on a specific plugin creates a sidechain to the pins of that plugin. The script supports two languages: English and Russian. The language can be changed by modifying the 'local language' line from 'eng' to 'ru'.</description>
